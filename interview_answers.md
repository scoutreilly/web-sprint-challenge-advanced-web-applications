Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. Explain what a token is used for.

- tokens are used for authentication in api calls. Some api's won't let you get data unless you have a token saying basically you're allowed to see that data

2. What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?

- Creating authentication before displaying any data. It's also a good idea to clear out the tokens so other users can't see or copy them. I'd say one of the easiest is just not displaying sensitive data.

3. Describe how web servers work.

- Web servers store data, code and they also host applications so users can visit the sites.

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

- create can be put or post, meaning to create or update data. read is get, to get and read info. Update is put and delete for deleting data.
